# bicycle_model
This is a Kinematic Bicycle Model for a forward and backward steering car (each case in separate
model).
To simulate the model behavior we use turtlesim node in ROS

The input form user should be:
 the time of simulation
 The car velocity
 The steering angle

The variable that should be stored in yaml:
 The distance between CG and front wheel(lf)
 The distance between CG and back wheel(lr)
