# bicycle_model
In This project, we will implement the **Kinematic Bicycle Model** for a forward and backward steering car (each case in separate model). To simulate the model behavior we use turtlesim node in ROS.
The **Kinematic Bicycle Model** equations are:

$$ \dot x = \nu \cos(\theta + \beta) $$

$$ \dot y = \nu \sin(\theta + \beta) $$

$$ \dot \theta = {(\nu \tan\delta\cos\beta)} \over L $$

$$ \beta = (\arctan(lr \tan\delta \over L) $$

Model Inputs:
  - The time of simulation
  - The car velocity
  - The steering angle(**Î´**)

The variable that stored in .yaml file :
  - The distance between CG and front wheel(**lf**)
  - The distance between CG and back wheel(**lr**)
